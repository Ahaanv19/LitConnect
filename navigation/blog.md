    <h2>Step 1: Planning and Preparation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Understand Project Requirements:</strong> Review the application’s technical needs, dependencies, and user requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Set Up Deployment Environment:</strong> Ensure environments (development, staging, production) are properly configured. This involves setting up servers, databases, and testing frameworks.</li>
        <li><strong>Assign Deployment Roles:</strong>
            <div class="roles">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Primary Deployment Admin:</strong> Ahaan – Responsible for overseeing the overall deployment process, ensuring smooth execution, and handling critical issues.</li>
                    <li><strong>Secondary Deployment Admins:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Jacob – Monitors staging and production server performance and supports troubleshooting.</li>
                            <li>Noah – Manages documentation and deployment scripts.</li>
                            <li>Arnav – Conducts final testing and validates post-deployment.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step 2: Building and Packaging</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Version Control:</strong> Ensure that the code repository (e.g., GitHub) has the latest stable branch ready for deployment.</li>
        <li><strong>Dependency Installation:</strong> Use package managers like npm (Node.js), pip (Python), or Maven (Java) to install all required dependencies.</li>
        <li><strong>Compile the Code:</strong> Build and bundle assets (e.g., using Webpack or Vite) and compile source code into production-ready formats.</li>
        <li><strong>Automated Testing:</strong> Execute unit tests and integration tests to validate the stability of the application.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step 3: Deployment to Staging</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Push Code to Staging Server:</strong> Use CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or Docker to deploy the latest build to the staging environment.</li>
        <li><strong>Conduct Staging Tests:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>UI responsiveness</li>
                <li>Database connections</li>
                <li>API integrations</li>
                <li>Load testing</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>All members collaborate to ensure quality during this phase.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step 4: Final Review</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Code Review and Approval:</strong> Team members conduct a final review of code and deployment plans, ensuring no critical errors exist.</li>
        <li><strong>Approval by Primary Deployment Admin:</strong> Ahaan grants the go-ahead for production deployment after confirming staging environment stability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step 5: Production Deployment</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Backup Production Environment:</strong> Take a snapshot or backup of the existing production environment for rollback purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>Deploy Code to Production:</strong> Use deployment scripts or automated tools to push changes to the production environment. Popular tools include:
            <ul>
                <li>Docker containers</li>
                <li>AWS Elastic Beanstalk</li>
                <li>Azure App Service</li>
                <li>Vercel or Netlify (for frontend apps)</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Monitor Logs and Metrics:</strong> Continuously monitor logs for errors and check performance metrics using tools like New Relic or Datadog.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step 6: Post-Deployment Verification</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Functionality Testing:</strong> Verify all critical functions of the application (e.g., login, data fetching, user interaction).</li>
        <li><strong>Communicate Success:</strong> Announce deployment completion to stakeholders and provide relevant links or credentials.</li>
        <li><strong>Feedback Collection:</strong> Collect user feedback and resolve any bugs reported post-deployment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step 7: Continuous Monitoring and Maintenance</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bug Fixes and Updates:</strong> Address post-deployment issues promptly and schedule minor updates as needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> Analyze performance data to improve application speed and reliability.</li>
        <li><strong>Document the Process:</strong> Update documentation with lessons learned, changes made, and insights gained during deployment.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By adhering to this structured deployment process and assigning clear roles, the team can ensure a reliable and efficient software release cycle. With Ahaan, Jacob, Noah, and Arnav managing key aspects, our deployment pipeline is robust and effective.</p>
